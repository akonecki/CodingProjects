# Lesson 3 - Recursion with Selection & Ordering Patterns
## Lesson Description
Implementation of actual recursion problems following one of the described recursion patterns listed below.
- Selection
- Ordering

## Problems
### Problem 1 - Word Break
#### Problem Statement
>
Given a string, that has no white spaces, a dictionary, that includes a list of valid words, find all the different ways in which the given string can be broken into a string of valid words.
>
Use the following function prototype
>

```
>
Example:
```
Input : "applepineapple", {"apple", "pine", "pineapple"}
