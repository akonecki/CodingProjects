# Chapter 8 - Object Oriented Design
## Description
This contains the questions that are reflected in Cracking the Coding Interview Fifth Edition specifically chapter 8.

## Problems
### Problem 1
#### Problem Statement
> Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards.  Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

#### Problem Discussion
- Dont know the rules for blackjack so would likely choose another game.

#### Problem Design
- card attributes are value and class.
- there would be a hand limit / idea of a hand
- need to be able to shuffle a deck
- need to setup the type of players and how they would interact with the deck (i.e. typically the house has a very specific set of rules).
- need a way to compare hands

#### Problem Issues
- left fairly generic
- didn't know how deep to go into implementation

#### Problem Solution
- provides a full implementation.
- solution provides a template solution of the definition of `Card` which was not taken into consideration for personal implementation.
